# Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree
## Project: Classic Arcade Game Clone




### Overview
Arcade game Frogger cloning is part of Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree curriculum (Module 4).  Using the provided visual assets and game loop engine, student needs to add a number of entities to the game including enemy and player characters to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

### Installation
Install/download the game using one of following methods:
* Clone from GitHub - https://github.com/DeemiTx/FEND_Proj_ClassicArcadeGameClone.git
* Download as Zip file - https://github.com/DeemiTx/FEND_Proj_ClassicArcadeGameClone/archive/master.zip

### How to Run the game
Once downloaded/installed, navigate to installation directory and open **index.html** in browser.

### How to Play the game
This game has a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal is to navigate the Player to water without running into enemies. Player can move left, right, up and down via keyboard keys. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion. Once player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won and player moves back to the start square.

Aero-keys will move the Player:
* Left: Moves Player to left
* Right: Moves Player to right
* Up: Moves Player up
* Down: Moves Player down

### Miscellaneous
Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
